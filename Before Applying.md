# Before Applying
This section focuses on the steps you should take before you apply or before your interview to ensure you're well-prepared.



## Researching the Company
This subsection emphasizes the importance of understanding the company's mission, values, products, and culture. It should guide you on how to research effectively, including looking at recent news about the company, reviewing their website and social media, and understanding their industry and competitors.

### Visit the Company's Website
Start with their official website. Look for information about their mission, vision, values, and culture. Understand their products or services. Check out the 'About Us' and 'Our Team' sections to get a sense of their history and leadership.

### Check Recent News
Look for recent news articles about the company. This can give you insight into their current projects, achievements, and future plans. You can use news search engines or simply type "Company Name News" into a search engine.

### Social Media and Blogs
Check their social media pages and official blog if they have one. These platforms often have up-to-date information about the company's activities and can give you a sense of their brand voice and values.

### Review Sites
Websites like [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), or [Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/) can provide insights into the company culture, salary ranges, and reviews from current and former employees.

### Industry Analysis
Understand the industry in which the company operates. Who are their competitors? What challenges does the industry face? This can help you understand the company's position in the market.

### Network
If possible, reach out to current or former employees through your network or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). They can provide firsthand insights that you might not find online.



## Understanding the Job Description
Here, you'll learn how to analyze the job description to understand the skills and experiences the company is looking for. This subsection should guide you on how to match your skills and experiences with the job requirements, and how to anticipate the topics that might come up during the interview based on the job description.

### Job Title
This usually gives an indication of the level of the role (entry, mid, senior, etc.) and the field or department (engineering, sales, HR, etc.).

### Job Summary
This section provides a brief overview of the role and its purpose within the company. It can give you a sense of what your day-to-day tasks might be.

### Responsibilities/Duties
This is often a list of tasks that you'll be expected to perform in the role. It's important to understand these as you'll need to demonstrate in your application and interview how you can fulfill these duties.



## Preparing Your Resume
This subsection provides tips on how to create a compelling resume that highlights your skills, experiences, and achievements that are relevant to the job. It should cover the key elements of a resume, including contact information, objective statement, work experience, education, skills, and references. It should also provide tips on tailoring your resume for each job application, and on proofreading to avoid any errors.

### Online Resume Tools
There are plenty of online tools you can use to help you quickly and professionally build your resume. Some are free-to-use and some are paid. One free tool I recommend is the [Resume Build](https://resumebuild.rezi.ai/) tool.

### Contact Information
At the top of your resume, include your full name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile if you have one. Make sure your email address is professional.

### Objective or Summary Statement
This is a brief section that outlines your career goals and why you’re a good fit for the job. Tailor this section to each job you apply for.

### Work Experience
List your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job. For each job, include the company name, your title, the dates you worked there, and bullet points that describe your responsibilities and achievements. Use action verbs and quantify your achievements when possible.

### Education
Include the degrees you've earned, the schools you attended, and the dates of graduation. If you're a recent graduate, you can also include your GPA if it's strong.

### Skills
List the skills that are relevant to the job you’re applying for. This can include both hard skills (like programming languages or tools you're proficient in) and soft skills (like communication or problem-solving).

### Certifications and Awards
If you have any relevant certifications or awards, include them in this section.

### Projects
If you have completed any projects relevant to the job, include a brief description of these. This is especially important for roles like software engineering or design, where you can showcase your portfolio.

### References
It's generally enough to state "References available upon request." You don't need to include the actual references on your resume.
